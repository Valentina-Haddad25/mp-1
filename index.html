      <h1>Hello, my name is Valentina Haddad!<br></h1>
      <p>I am currently a senior at Boston University, where I am double majoring in Computer Science and English, and serve as a Resident Assistant. Over the years, I have gained a diverse range of experiences in both technical and leadership roles, which have helped me develop a unique skill set.
        I have interned as an Artificial Intelligence Community Analyst for the Library of Congress and as a Cybersecurity intern for the Department of Treasury. I have enjoyed my time in the government sectors!</br>
